* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page 
* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text 
* THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page 
* WHEN I click on the Save icon 
* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes 
* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
